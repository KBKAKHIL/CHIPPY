# Template for building Android Games

This is the starting code template for building a 2D game in Android.

Most games are built using a framework (Unity, SpriteKit, [Phaser](https://phaser.io/)) - and we will too. But for the first part of the course, we will build our own custom game engine to learn how game mechanics work.

## How to use the template

### OPTION 1 - Download entire project

1. Download the repository
2. Open the repo using Android Studio


** WARNING: ** Sometimes, this process will not work. If it doesn't work, try OPTION 2 below.


### OPTION 2 - Manually create the project

1. Create a new project in Android Studio

2. Add two files to your project

    - `MainActivity.java` (this should already exist when you create a new project )
	- `GameEngine.java`  (you need to add this!)

3. Copy and paste code from Bitbucket GameEngine & MainActivity into your project

	- GameEngine.java: [click here](https://bitbucket.org/jenelleteaches/androidgametemplate-s19/src/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/parrot/pong1/GameEngine.java)
	- MainActivity.java: [click here](https://bitbucket.org/jenelleteaches/androidgametemplate-s19/src/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/parrot/pong1/MainActivity.java)

4. Don't forget to update the *package names* to match your project.
	
	- The package name shown above is: `com.example.parrot.myapplication`
	- You will need to change this to match your package name.

## Expected Output

If you run the program, you will get a blank screen. Like this:
